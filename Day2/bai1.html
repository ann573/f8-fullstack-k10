    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremly</i> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum scaled in plastic) into a wter bath thar is 
    aprecisele set to the target temperature you want to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking fir Geeks</em>, Jess Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b>. To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
