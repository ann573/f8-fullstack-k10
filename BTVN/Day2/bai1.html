    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
      This week I am <em>extremly</em> excited about cooking technique called
      <i>sous vide</i>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the
      food(usually vacuum scaled in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele
      set to the target temperature you want to be cooked to. In his book,
      <cite><em>Cooking fir Geeks</em></cite
      >, Jess Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".
    </p>
    <p>
      Next month, we will be serving
      <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</str>. To reserve a seat ar the
      chef table, contact us before November 30.
